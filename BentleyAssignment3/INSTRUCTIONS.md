##Assignment 3: Number Guess Modification


**Objectives:**
  This assignment is pretty straight forward as long as you follow the textbook 
  and complete the reading from this week's module. 
  It is based on the number guess game examples in chapter 3 of our book. 
  Review chapter 3,  and the files numberGame_1.html through numberGame_4.html  included in the source files . 

**Make the following modifications to numberGame_4.html:**

  1. Adjust the random numbers so they are 1- 50 rather than 0- 99.
  2. Change the game so it only allows 5 guesses.
  3. Place at least four of the game variables into an object literal; 
  they should be properties of an object literal. 
  To do this you may want to create an object literal named numberGame 
  - or something similar- and place those variables into that object.
  4. Change the background color of the browser window, or of an area of the screen, when the user wins and loses. 
  For example you may want to have the screen turn blue if the player loses, and yellow if the player wins. 
  5. Aside from that you may go as crazy as you want improving the bells and whistles on this project.
  6. Place the CSS and Javascript into external files.
