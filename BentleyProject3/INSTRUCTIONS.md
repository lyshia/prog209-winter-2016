##Project 3 Canvas Animation Game: Monster Zap


**Description:** Referencing Chapter 6 and 7 of the book, online content for Module 5 and 6, 
you will create an animated game using HTML5 canvas technology.
The object of the game will be to 'zap' or click on as many moving monsters on 
the screen as possible within a fixed period of time.


Here is a screenshot of a sample game screen (your version will hopefully look different and unique):

	1. The monster images – or “sprites” as they are generally referred to in game technology –
       	   will appear at random times in the canvas area at random places, 
           and move vertically or horizontally in real time.

	2. After 2 seconds they will disappear. If the user “zaps” a sprite by clicking on it,
	   the sprite will be replaced with a "Hit" image (e.g., explosion) which does not move and disappears after 1 second. 
	   Your game should support 3 different sprite images. 
	
	3. The game must maintain/display a running counter to keep track of the user's game score (the number of monsters zapped). 
	   It will increment by one every time the user clicks on a monster image, but not when the explosion is displayed 
	   player shouldn't get extra points for clicking on the explosion).

	4. Your game must also use a countdown timer and display the current number of seconds remaining in the game.
           When it times out, the animations should freeze and a end game message of some kind must be displayed.
           You can set the countdown timer to any number, but you'll probably want to keep it down to around 30 seconds.

	5. The image above shows a scary font for effect, but you are not required to use a custom font. 
	   You should however, provide some basic game instruction (one short sentence will do it)
           and label your game stats (timer and game score) appropriately.
	   While canvas can display text, the text for your game must be displayed using CSS 
           which provides much better flexibility.

	6. The project will need a welcome screen (start screen that goes away when the player presses a start button) 
	   and an end screen that gives the players' score.

	7. Add your name,date,  and your own comments to the code. Do not copy large chunks of code from other people. 
	   This is akin to cheating and can result in 0 points or expulsion from the College.

Be sure to work through the Monster Smash example in Chapter  6 of the textbook as well as techniques from chapter 7, 
where you'll find a lot of information that will help you complete this project.

Project Variability: We will allow some flexibility in timing, since as you test your game, 
you may find it plays better if something happens for a slightly shorter/longer period of time. 
This is only natural, as any game that hits the market is the result of hundreds of hours of testing and tweaking. 
Don't spend a hundred hours on this project, however.
