#Assignment 2: Color Picker

Description:
The goal of the assignment is to use a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to control 
the background colors displayed in a div. 
Extra Credit of 2 points for providing the hex value of the color.
 Extra credit means it is not required.

The user will type in numerical color values into a form text field. 
The numbers the user enters will be from 0 through 255. 
This is for each color channel (Red, Green, Blue). 
It will  modify the CSS to display a new color in a div area. 
Below is a screenshot of a working example:

Your submission does not need to match the example exactly, but you may use the example as a guide.

1. Numerical values should be checked that they are numbers and in the specified range. 
If the number falls out of range (less than 0 or greater than 255 for example) 
then reset the text fields and the color in the target div area. 
Also, provide some feedback (like an alert popup) so the user is made aware of their error.

2. There should be a button to submit the numbers and to set the new color to the target div.

3. There should also be a button to reset the background color of the div, and clear the text in the form field.
